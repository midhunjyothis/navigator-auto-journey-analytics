"""
This module generates raw (bronze-layer) datasets for the
Navigator Auto Journey analytics project.

It produces deterministic, realistic synthetic data for:
- raw_customers
- raw_vehicles
- raw_events

The generation logic follows the assumptions and definitions
documented in /docs and is intended to support analytics
development, experimentation, and data quality validation.
